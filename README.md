# entangled
Some GSD and Hoomd tools to study the primitive path mesh and entanglements in dense polymer systems.

Goal:
Implement the algorithm and analysis as discussed in the paper [Identifying the primitive path mesh in entangled polymer liquids](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/polb.20384) using the [Hoomd-Blue](https://github.com/glotzerlab/hoomd-blue) simulation engine and the [GSD](https://github.com/glotzerlab/gsd) file format.
